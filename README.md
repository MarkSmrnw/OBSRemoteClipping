# PLEASE NOTE,
I only intended this to be used on windows systems.
I might add linux soon, maybe... Idrk

# HOW TO RUN:

For Clients: Run the startclient.bat file.
This will start the client.py file.

For Servers. Run the startserver.bat file.
This will start the jsonserver.py

The server is there for saving and handling json to save what client is connected.
